# Introduction
Exploratory analysis of the Speed Dating dataset to identify the factors driving the decision to meet a partner again. Project focused on understanding key matching drivers for Tinder: attractiveness, shared interests, fun, and the impact of user goals.

# Background
Tinder’s marketing team is facing a decrease in matches on the app and wants to better understand what drives mutual interest.
To support this objective, a speed dating experiment was conducted where participants rated their partners on several attributes and indicated whether they would like to meet them again.

# Tools I used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for exploratory analysis

# The Analysis
The analysis focuses on:
- Comparing mean attribute scores between “Yes” and “No” decisions
- Measuring score differences to identify the most discriminating factors
- Segmenting results by user goals to understand how motivations influence decision-making
The main attributes studied are: attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests.

# What I Learned
This project strengthened my ability to structure an end-to-end exploratory analysis, from data cleaning to insight generation. I consolidated my skills in Python, Pandas, and data visualization libraries, notably through the use of loops and reusable logic to efficiently analyze multiple segments and variables.
I also reinforced an analytical approach focused on interpretability and decision-making rather than pure modeling.

# Conclusions
Through a structured exploratory data analysis, this project demonstrates how data can support business decision-making by identifying clear and actionable drivers of mutual interest in early interactions.
Beyond the insights themselves, it highlights my ability to build clean and well-structured analysis pipelines, leverage Python libraries efficiently, and translate quantitative findings into practical recommendations for marketing and product teams, such as optimizing user profiles, matching features, and experience personalization based on user motivations.
